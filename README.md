# Multi-Serial-Demo
 A simple demo of using all three UARTs in the ESP32-S3 dev kit.
 
 The root directory contains a Platform IO ESP32 project that sends messages to 3 serial ports (using built-in hardware UARTs).
 The zip file in the root directory is a archive of a PSoC5LP project that reads a serial port and forwards the data to the computer.
